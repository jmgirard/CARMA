# CARMA
Software for Continuous Affect Rating and Media Annotation
(c) Jeffrey M Girard, 2014-2017

CARMA is a media annotation program that collects continuous ratings while displaying audio and video files. It is designed to be highly user-friendly and easily customizable. CARMA enables researchers and study participants to provide moment-by-moment ratings of multimedia files using a computer mouse, keyboard, or joystick. The rating scale can be configured on a number of parameters including its labels and numerical range. Annotations can be displayed alongside the multimedia file and saved for easy import into statistical analysis software. CARMA provides a tool for researchers in affective computing, human-computer interaction, and the social sciences who need to capture the unfolding of subjective experience and observable behavior over time.

## History
CARMA was first published by Jeffrey Girard in 2014 under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPUv3). Users are free to use, distribute, and modify the program as outlined in the license. CARMA is meant to be a modernization of Gottman & Levenson's affect rating dial. A journal publication describing CARMA and its use was published in 2014. However, note that the program and its functionality have changed a lot since that initial publication.
